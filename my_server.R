  #   as a percentage of the total population and the CO2 emissions by each country. Under each tab, there are different visualizations
  #   and comparisons of how these indicators influence each other and how they answer questions about cultures in countries across the
  #   globe. First, a little bit of background of these indicators is necessary, outlining both what they are and how they are calculated.
  #   GDP per capita, or Gross Domestic Product, is a measure of a country's economy and how many people are living in that country. It is
  #   calculated by taking the GDP and then dividing it by the population of that country. So, GDP per capita is a way of putting a number
  #   to the standard of living in the countries by measuring the amount of people and the countries gross domestic product. For clarification,
  #   gross domestic product is the total amount of goods and services provided by a country during one fiscal year. As for the urban population
  #   indicator, it is quite simple, it is the amount the amount of people living in the country divided by the amount of people in the country
  #   living in an urban area, giving the resulting percentage of people living in urban areas in each country. Lastly, CO2 emissions are
  #   the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. In this case, the CO2 emissions are calculated on the scale of metric tons
  #   per capita, which means that it is the metric tons of CO2 emissions divided by the total population of each country in order to get a
  #   relative scale for each country. This way it is based more on how much they are producing relative to how big their population is, rather
  #   than just the amount of CO2 emissions in total. The following report was created to show the effects of urban living and GDP on the CO2
  #   emissions from 1990-2016. The data also allows for a look into how industrialization (higher gdp) has impacted urban living and the CO2
  #   emissions. The following data all comes from the", paste0(a("World Bank Group", href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator?tab=all"), "."),
