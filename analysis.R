#what needs to be done:
##Each of us need to ask a couple of analytical questions that we can then answer using the data?
###The requirements say that we can't just include visualizations, we should for each question, but we also need to answer the question
###using our data. 

##QUESTIONS - choice one (maternal, life, income)
#How does income per capita effect the life expectancy and and maternal mortality rate, is a positive or negative correlation or no correlation?
#What is the average life expectancy in the world and for each country?
#Why are maternal mortality rates different between countries, does it tie into income per capita
#What countries have the highest and lowest life expectancies, what is the average life expectancy?

##QUESTIONS - choice two (co2 emissions, urban population, gdp per capita)
#Does the GDP per capita effect the amount of co2 emissions by a country? 
#Do countries that have a higher urban population percent tend to see, a higher gdp per capita?
#Do countries with high co2 emissions have a greater density of urban population?
#Which countries have the lowest and highest amounts of co2 emissions and why? 


#these can all be made into tables and maps now

##shiny app
###must be interactive, include visualizations, text must be interactive based on user selections
###must have links to where we got the information from
###must have interactive widgets and answer our critical questions
####optional, use some css to style our shiny app so that it doesn't look so plain, only if time permitting
##We should try to make an interactive map
